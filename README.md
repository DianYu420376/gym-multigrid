# Multigrid Covering Game Environment (COMPSCI 236R Course Project)

Code modified from the original multigrid environment https://github.com/ArnaudFickinger/gym-multigrid

The Code implemented independent PPO learning for multi-agent dynamic covering game with different reward design (identical interest, Leave-one-out, Shapley-variants)

Run test_env.py to test the code.
